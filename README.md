# Chargemap StatisticsðŸ”Œ

This is a little project that aims to provide statistics about the charging stations in France. It uses puppeteer and open endpoints from Chargemap to retrieve your invoices and charge sessions. To have a better understanding of the retrieved data, I've created a modern dashboard.

## How to use it ?

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlxisHenry/chargemap-statistics.git
```

2. Move to the project directory

```bash
cd chargemap-statistics
```

3. Install the puppeteer dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill the `.env` file with your credentials

```bash
CHARGEMAP_EMAIL="<email>"
CHARGEMAP_PASSWORD="<password>"
CHARGEMAP_ACCOUNT_ID="<account_id>"
```

Note: To get your `CHARGEMAP_ACCOUNT_ID`, you can inspect the network requests when you are on the charge sessions page and look for the `user_id` parameter.

5. Run the scraper

```bash
pnpm start
```

6. Start the dashboard

```bash
cd app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

7. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
